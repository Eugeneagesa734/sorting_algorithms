0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O project
This project focuses on the sorting algorithms in C language and we learn how to implement them.

General
At least four different sorting algorithms
What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
What is a stable sorting algorithm
